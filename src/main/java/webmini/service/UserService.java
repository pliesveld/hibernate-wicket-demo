/**
 * I am not sure of the purpose of this separation.  
 *
 * I think this is supposed simply the finding of DAOs once more models have been added to the system.
 * Or to differentiate between different types of DAOS.  For example; if, in adddition to the hibernate DAO I currently have,
 * there was another UserDao that specialized in XML files.  Then the service layer could provide a centralized place
 * for the client code to instantiate the DAO objects of a particular type.
 *
 * But at the moment, there is only one DAO class, @see webmini.model.UserDao
